# Heatmap Generator with plotly



Welcome to my heatmap generator for League of Legends. I developped this script for my brother to analyse the warding pattern of enemies or his team to give him a statistical advantage.

I created this app within 4 weeks. The GUI instantiates a Heatmap and via clicks on the canvas in the GUI you can set 4 different kinds of wards on the canvas. If you completed the setting you can either generate heatmaps for each kind of ward or all wards together. Theres also a first version of api parser for riot's api. Keep in mind that you need a plotly account and set up the Username and key in Heatmap.py.

## Usage
To use this script you can download the repository and run Heatmap.py.

You are welcome to contribute to this project in any shape or form
(improving the software, doing data analysis, improving the GUI (based on tkinter)).
